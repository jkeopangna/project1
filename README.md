Elemental Listening

Inside Elemental Listening we provide users with diverse music playlists from Spotify based on the weather conditions in your area. Through our back-end development process we fetch data from two server side APIs, OpenWeatherMap and Spotify. The design and layout for the front-end of this application is based off of the mobile-first framework UIKit.

You may find yourself searching for that perfect song to set the mood for a snowy evening. Simply enter your location in the search bar and Spotify will provide recommended playlists to immerse yourself into that snowfall. Click on that playlist to enhance the mood and start your Elemental Listening.
